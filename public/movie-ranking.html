<h3>
    3 Idiots
</h3>
<p> 
    Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently,
    even as the rest of the world called them "idiots".
</p>

<h3>
    Harry potter and the Philisopher's Stone
</h3>
<p>
    Does a magnificent job in bringing to life the unique world of magic and fantasy that, until its mega-hyped release, existed only in the imaginations of author J.K. 
    Rowling's devoted readership.
</p>

<h3>
    Iron Man
</h3>
<p>
    Iron Man manages to be both a lot of fun, and quite possibly the most effective commentary on the war on terror that Hollywood has produced so far -- 
    not the best argued or the most committed, but the one that most people will see, and think about.
